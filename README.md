> Tools and libraries Android programmers should know about.

## Overview

I've been working with Android for several years, and yet I still encounter
libraries or tools I wish I'd known about earlier.

This repo aggregates such tools by providing links to resources that
Android programmers should know are available, even if they never use them.

## Testing

1. [Robolectric](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric) A testing
framework that provides much more functionality than Android's stock testing
support and does not require an attached device.
1. [AssertJ Android](https://github.com/square/assertj-android) Provides an
intuitive fluent-style assertion syntax for Android (formerly FEST Android).

## Persistence

1. [SQLite Asset Helper](https://github.com/jgilfelt/android-sqlite-asset-helper)
Simplifies the process of shipping with an updating SQLite databases.

## Network

1. [Robospice](https://github.com/stephanenicolas/robospice). Attempts to
simplify the process of dealing with async tasks and network requests.
1. [Android Async HTTP](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) Simplifies
network requests by abstracting away direct interactions with the apache http
client.

## Build

1. [Gradle Build System](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system)
The site for the Gradle build system, including usage and release notes.
